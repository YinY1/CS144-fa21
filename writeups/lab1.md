Lab 1 Writeup
=============

My name: [Kal'tsit]

My SUNet ID: [666]

This lab took me about [5] hours to do.

Program Structure and Design of the StreamReassembler:

    vector<pair<char,int>> _unassembled; // has a size of capacity
    _unassembled_size;
    size_t _eof_pos{SIZE_MAX};
    size_t _unassembled_size{};
    ByteStream _output;
    size_t _capacity;


Implementation Challenges:
[understanding meaning of segment and its edge condition]
